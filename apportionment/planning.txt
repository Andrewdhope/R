Goal: a map to display congressional density if the congressional apportionment amendment were ratified. Total representatives per state, or adjusted number of representatives within existing districts.
	- Revision: a set of plots to let the user see the effect of different apportionment methods. Current, Article I, Wyoming, with adjustable params. Show the seats per state, size of seats, and delta influence. Less of an argument, more of an interactive that supports a conclusion.
