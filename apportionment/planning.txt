"After the first enumeration required by the first article of the Constitution, there shall be one representative for every thirty thousand, until the number shall amount to one hundred, after which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress, that there shall not be less than one hundred representatives, nor less than one representative for every forty thousand persons, until the number of representatives shall amount to two hundred, after which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress, that there shall not be less than two hundred representatives, nor more than one representative for every fifty thousand."

Design:
- Tabs for potential variants
	+ Literal interpretation
	+ Sequential/Extrapolated interpretation
- Historical apportionment
	+ Retro-fit proposed variants on historical population values
- Use accepted allocation formula to allocate to states
- Compare relative influence
	+ e.g. WY had 1/53rd of CA, now has 1/65th.
