#### Drastic Reduction in Variance  
Expanding the House would directly reduce the variance in the average number of constituents per seat. When every seat represents hundreds of thousands of people, states that are on the cusp of gaining or losing a  seat see wide differences in their relative levels of representation. When each seat represents a smaller set of constituents, being positioned on the cusp does not result in such a significant difference.   

For example, using the 2010 census... mean, variance, range, Rhode Island. Compared to uncapped version of the stats and Vermont.

While precise district sizes depend on the congressional maps drawn by each state, the variance in representation can still be estimated by simply observing the average number of constituents per seat, per state. This analysis essentially uses hypothetical state-level districts that are exactly equivalent in size. This method actually minimizes the calculated variance. In reality, where districts are drawn unequally, the variance in represendation would be greater.
