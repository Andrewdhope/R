While the count of representatives in each state increases significantly, the ***relative influence*** of a state remains consistent when moving from a capped to an uncapped system.  

Switching the seat limit between the capped and uncapped options does not change the ***ordering*** of state seat counts. A state's relative level of influence remains steady under the two methods, the only difference being several ties that are broken when shifting to the uncapped model.  

Intuitively, such a major change to House membership would seem to necessarily swing the balance of power within the chamber. However, it is the apportionment method[^[3]](#references), and not the seat limit, that controls the relative influence of each state.
