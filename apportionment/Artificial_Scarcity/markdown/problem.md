### Problem Summary  

In 1813, each House member represented an average of 37,535 constituents. 200 years later, the national average had grown to 710,190 constituents per seat.  

A representative with a larger district is more difficult to engage. A smaller district will have fewer voices competing for the office's attention. The cost of access, whether measured in dollars or in level-of-effort, decreases along with a reduction in a district's size.  

Along with a growing national average, there is an increasing level of variance when comparing the average constituents per seat for each state. With the 2013 apportionment, the two House members from Rhode Island represented an average of 526,284 Rhode Islanders, while the single representative from Montana sat for 989,415 Montanans.   

The variance between the most-represented and least-represented states lessens the level of congressional influence for the citizens of some small states.  

Both the national average, and the variance between state-level averages are **guaranteed** to expand under the current system of apportionment. Over time, House members will become more expensive to access, and the gap between the most-represented and least-represented states will widen.
