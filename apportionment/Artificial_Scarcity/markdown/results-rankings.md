An expanded House essentially reduces the "representation step-size" for each apportioned seat.  

Intuitively, with such a major change to the structure of the House, one would expect to see a dramatic swing in the balance of power within the chamber. However, it is the apportionment method, and not the seat limit, that controls the relative influence of each state.  

This is depicted in the accomanying plot. Switching the seat limit between the capped and uncapped options does not change the ordering of state seat counts. State levels of influence remain steady under the two models, the only difference being several ties that are broken when shifting to the uncapped model.
