The relative influence of each state can be measured by simply calculating their percentage of total House seats. We can then subtract a state's relative influence under a capped system, from their relative influence uncapped. The adjacent ***delta influence*** plot shows very small changes in relative influence between the capped and uncapped models.

The maximum delta belongs to Texas, whose relative influence is reduced by merely 0.12%. In a 435 member House, 0.12% influence equates to roughly one half of one representative.  

House expansion does not significantly alter the relative power of any individual state.
